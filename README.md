# 🖼️ ImageCrypt – Image Encryption Tool

**ImageCrypt** is a simple yet effective image encryption tool built as part of **Skillcraft Technology Internship – Task 2**.  
It scrambles the pixels of an image using mathematical operations and logical transformations, making the image unrecognizable until decrypted.

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 **Pixel Scrambling:** Rearranges and swaps pixel positions.
- ➕ **Mathematical Operations:** Apply arithmetic transformations across the pixel matrix.
- 📂 **Supports Multiple Formats:** Works with PNG, JPG, JPEG, and more.
- 🔄 **Encryption & Decryption:** Restore the original image from encrypted data.
- 🌐 **Web-based UI:** Simple and intuitive web interface.

---

## 🧪 How It Works
1. User uploads an image via the Flask web app.
2. The program processes pixel data using **JAVASCRIPT**.
3. Custom mathematical logic scrambles pixels to produce an encrypted image.
4. The decryption process reverses the scrambling, restoring the original image.
